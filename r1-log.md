# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Rich Keyzor

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on January 3rd, 2018.

## Progress Log

### R1D1 03-01-2018
So this was me getting organised. Synced my local files with previously abandoned GitHub repo for the Pomodoro Clock challenge.

Had updated to macOS High Sierra so had to install xcode command line tools with `xcode-select --install` to get Git running again.
All good so ran the tests on my app and passed 15/29 so a long way to go.

Now off to tweet about this and also tell the freeCodeCamp Salisbury group to see if anyone interested.
