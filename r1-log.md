# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Rich Keyzor

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on January 3rd, 2018.

## Progress Log

### R1D1 03-01-2018
So this was me getting organised. Synced my local files with previously abandoned GitHub repo for the Pomodoro Clock challenge.

Had updated to macOS High Sierra so had to install xcode command line tools with `xcode-select --install` to get Git running again.
All good so ran the tests on my app and passed 15/29 so a long way to go.

Now off to tweet about this and also tell the freeCodeCamp Salisbury group to see if anyone interested.

### R1D2 04-01-2018
Now today I was trying to get back in the Git saddle for the following purpose:
1. To keep things organised i.e. create a new branch for each day's work and merge when I'm happy. Is that a good idea? Anyway totally lost it with Git commands so need to a branching refresher before D3!!
2. So that my changes are committed and show in the contributions on my profile.

This took me over an hour to get it all wrong and decide I need a Git refresher.

### R1D3 06-01-2018
Working on my [issue#1](https://github.com/Web-Dev-Rich/fcc-pomodoro-clock/issues/1)

I have resolved the issue of multiple setIntervals being set off when the Start/Stop button clicked and have now passed 17/29 tests. But The timer does not start again after stopping it so that needs more work. It is just working out the right program flow.

I realise that I need to do a flowchart or something before I start coding a project in future else I just get in a muddle.

Created a [issue#1 Git branch](https://github.com/Web-Dev-Rich/fcc-pomodoro-clock/tree/issue%231) to work on this issue and pushed to the remote repo with `git push --set-upstream origin issue#1`. Not sure of that was the right thing to do or if I should have just kept it local and pushed when resolved. The problem will be tidying it all up later - still good Git/GitHub practice.

### R1D4 06-01-2018
Resolved the multiple `setInterval()` issue using many `console.log()` lines and functionality seems to work although not passing the reset test from [issue#1](https://github.com/Web-Dev-Rich/fcc-pomodoro-clock/issues/1)

### R1D5 07-01-2018
Taking a break from Pomodoro and have asked a question in Slack about my session/break incrementing/decrementing. It seems that each time reset is clicked the increment doubles for each click of the buttons! Weird - I wonder if it is something to do with variable scoping??

I've set up my [Tic Tac Toe project on GitHub](https://github.com/Web-Dev-Rich/fcc-tictactoe). I started this a while ago from a tutorial.
