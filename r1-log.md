# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Rich Keyzor

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on January 3rd, 2018.

## Progress Log

### R1D1 03-01-2018
So this was me getting organised. Synced my local files with previously abandoned GitHub repo for the Pomodoro Clock challenge.

Had updated to macOS High Sierra so had to install xcode command line tools with `xcode-select --install` to get Git running again.
All good so ran the tests on my app and passed 15/29 so a long way to go.

Now off to tweet about this and also tell the freeCodeCamp Salisbury group to see if anyone interested.

### R1D2 04-01-2018
Now today I was trying to get back in the Git saddle for the following purpose:
1. To keep things organised i.e. create a new branch for each day's work and merge when I'm happy. Is that a good idea? Anyway totally lost it with Git commands so need to a branching refresher before D3!!
2. So that my changes are committed and show in the contributions on my profile.

This took me over an hour to get it all wrong and decide I need a Git refresher.
