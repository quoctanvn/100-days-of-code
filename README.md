# I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge.

I have been working on the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) since January 2016 (err that'll be 2 years now!) and after initial quick progress have got bogged down in the advanced front end projects and currently the [Pomodoro Clock Challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-pomodoro-clock). I have found it hard to find the time and motivation to fit in coding with life's other temptations.

Also I started [freeCodeCamp Salisbury](https://www.meetup.com/Free-Code-Camp-Salisbury-UK/) and tend to get ribbed every month for my lack of progress!

So this is an attempt to instill some discipline.
